## üîß API Integration

### New Endpoints Used
- `GET /api/v1/features` - Check feature availability
- `POST /api/v1/generate-enhanced/stories/{id}/chapters/{num}` - Enhanced generation
- `POST /api/v1/generate-enhanced/stories/{id}/chapters/{num}/multi-pass` - Multi-pass generation
- `POST /api/v1/generate-enhanced/stories/{id}/chapters/{num}/analyze-quality` - Quality analysis

### Enhanced Types
```typescript
interface EnhancedGenerationRequest {
  target_word_count?: number;
  quality_check?: boolean;
  custom_prompt?: string;
}

interface QualityAnalysisResponse {
  quality_score: number;
  word_count: number;
  paragraph_count: number;
  dialogue_count: number;
  issues: string[];
  suggestions: string[];
  style_consistency: number;
  readability_score: number;
}
```
