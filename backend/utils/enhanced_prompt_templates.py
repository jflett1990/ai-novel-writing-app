WHILE WRITING:
- Write in scenes, not summary
- Use active voice and concrete details
- Let characters drive the action through their choices
- Include conflict in every scene (external or internal)
- End each scene with momentum toward the next

WORD COUNT TRACKING:
- Aim for {target_word_count} words total
- Check progress every 500 words
- If falling short, add more scenes or expand existing ones
- If running long, tighten prose but maintain all required elements

QUALITY CHECKLIST:
- Does every paragraph advance the story?
- Are characters making meaningful choices?
- Is the dialogue authentic and purpose-driven?
- Have you avoided all forbidden phrases and patterns?
- Does the chapter end with compelling forward momentum?

   - Character arcs that intersect unexpectedly
   - Thematic threads woven throughout
   - Rising action that builds in complexity, not just intensity

2. CHARACTER-DRIVEN PLOT DEVELOPMENT:

   - Character relationships evolve and complicate throughout
   - Internal conflicts drive external action

3. AVOID PREDICTABLE STRUCTURES:
   - No "chosen one" or "fish out of water" unless subverted
   - Avoid convenient coincidences or deus ex machina solutions
   - Problems create new problems rather than simple escalation
   - Multiple valid interpretations of events and character motivations

4. CHAPTER DESIGN FOR SUBSTANTIAL CONTENT:
   - Each chapter should contain 2-4 distinct scenes
   - Minimum 2000-3000 words worth of content per chapter
   - Multiple character interactions per chapter
   - Balance of action, dialogue, character development, and description
